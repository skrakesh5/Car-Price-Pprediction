# Car-Price-Prediction

A Chinese automobile company Geely Auto aspires to enter the US market by setting up their manufacturing unit there and producing cars locally to give competition to their US and European counterparts.
Essentially, the company wants to know: 
> Which variables are significant in predicting the price of a car.
> How well those variables describe the price of a car.

The goal is to model the price of cars with the available independent variables.
